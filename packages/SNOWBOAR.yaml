  ## The game
  
  This game is a love-letter to those early MSX games created by Konami in the mid 80s. Small and simple but with great playability, colorful graphics and catchy tunes.
  
  Every MSX lover out there remembers the great sport games, along with titles such as Hyper Rally, Road Fighter, Antarctic Adventure, Sky Jaguar and many others.
  
  That’s why we at Relevo decided to create this game as a humble tribute to Konami, trying to come up with a game featuring the same look and feel of those we still remember and play with a smile in our faces. We sincerely hope you enjoy playing Relevo’s Snowboarding.
