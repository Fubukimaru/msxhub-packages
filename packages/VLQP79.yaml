description: |
  Amy lived her happy life in a pretty normal town... until that fateful accident at the nearby research facility. Officials denied the incident at first, until the entire facility was abandoned. Neighbours started acting weird. Amy didn’t feel safe anymore. While trying to leave town, she found herself running from a hoard of zombies. What Amy didn't expect, was to find other survivors. Help her escape and rescue the ones not infected by the LQP-79 virus. Hurry!
  
  Port to MSX of the Arduboy game of Team Arg. ( https://github.com/TEAMarg/ID-40-VIRUS-LQP-79 )
