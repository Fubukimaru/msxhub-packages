description: |
  VGMPlay can play back music for quite a number of sound chips using various common and less common sound expansions for MSX, such as the PSG, MoonSound and Yamaha SFG. A detailed list can be found below.
  
  Both the VGM and VGZ formats are supported. The compressed VGZ format takes longer to load but also consumes less disk space. If so desired, VGZ files can be manually decompressed to VGM with gunzip for MSX or PC.
  
  The timing resolution is 50 or 60 Hz on MSX1 machines with a TMS9918 VDP, 300 Hz on machines with a V9938 or V9958 VDP, and 4000 Hz on MSX turboR.
