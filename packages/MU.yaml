description: |
  μ(MU) is a mapper management system with RAM-disk driver for MSX-DOS 1.
  Up to two RAM-disks can be used. To use MU, a memory mapper of at least 80K
  is required. MU does not work under MSX-DOS 2. On turboR press the [1] key
  during startup until the "beep" if the disk is formatted under MSX-DOS2 or
  Disk-BASIC 2.0.
  
  The memory mapper BIOS can be used with MSX - DOS 1. Since it is compatible
  with DOS 2's, programs created for DOS 2's memory mapper BIOS can be made
  to work with DOS 1 + μ with some additional code.
  
  Also, since the RAM disk driver is built in, you can use RAM disk with DOS 1.
  You can create up to 2 drives of 1 Mbyte RAM disk.
  
  In addition, a routine that accelerates access to the floppy disk is built in.
