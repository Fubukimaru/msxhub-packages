description: |
  Any Treasure Day is the 8th entry for MSXdev’18. It is a text adventure. This game was made a while ago, and now it is released as an engine test compatible with the Graphical Adventure Creator. The author recommends not to play this adventure using C-BIOS at this point.
  
  > While exploring the countryside, you find a sign.
  > It says: “Any Treasure Day! Bring any treasures here! You will be
  > rewarded with Fame, Money, Food! Anything!”
