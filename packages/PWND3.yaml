description: |
  The snake returns! After paying a visit to the MSXdev’08 contest ten years ago, its quite familiar mechanics are here again to twist our minds.
  
  This time around, though, apart from eating flowers, our snake is able to pass through certain walls by picking up yellow exclamation marks. Also, arrows limit our movement as we can only pass over them in the designated direction.
  
  It’s probably clear by now that it’s wise to plan your path carefully, because the mazes available are a little bit tricky.
