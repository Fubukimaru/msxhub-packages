description: |
  As member of the elite corps [PACHOUND], your mission is to sneak into the [GHOST HEAVEN] fortress, eat all the blips that you'll find around, avoid the evil ghosts and get out of there as quick as possible.
  
  ## Your Mission
  
  Eating all the blips is not going to be easy with all those ghosts trying to kill you.
  Use the objects spread around the map and your best tactics to advance into your mission. Get the Pows with precaution and confront the enemies only when you have a chance to win.
  If you maintain cold blood, you can success and be a hero.
  
  ## About the Game
  
  Cold Blood is a crossover between the classic Pac-Man and Metal Gear. You need to eat all the blips on each level, but you need to avoid the ghosts, use objects and find your way out.
