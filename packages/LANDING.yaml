description: |
  In this game, our mission is to guide one of them as it goes down the screen, using an umbrella as a parachute (remarkably, this specimen doesn’t seem to rely much on his cat superpower of landing safely from great heights).
  
  As you float towards the safe ground, be cautious of birds, because if they hit the umbrella the damage gauge will go up. If damage reaches 100%, the game will be over. If you want to descend faster, use the cursor down.
  
  Try to get the best score you can!
