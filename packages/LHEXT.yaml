  For MSX-DOS. LZH extractor LHext

  LHext Version 1.33
  Copyright (C) 1995 by KYOJU


  This is a tool for decompressing .LZH files with MSX-DOS.
  ∙ Supports -lh6-, and decompression of -lh5- is faster than PMext.


  Operating environment

  Works with MSX-DOS (1).

  - MSX-DOS (1) without mapper BIOS and -Lh6-
     -lh7- cannot be decompressed. -lh5- can also be decompressed on this system.


  Startup format

  LHEXT [command] [archive name] [member name ..] [{/ |-} option ..]

  [Instruction] Specify the operation of LHext.
  If omitted, the e command is selected.
  Usually it must be written at the beginning without options, but / or
  -You can write anywhere in the form by prefixing it.

  [[Archive name] Specify the archive file name.
  If the extension is omitted, .LZH is assumed.
  If you do not specify the archive name, a help message appears.

  [Member Name] Specify what you want to process among the files stored in the archive.
  You can use wildcards. You can specify more than one.
  Omitting the member name is the same as specifying *. *.
  
  The [Option] Used for operation settings.
  Options can appear anywhere in the form.

  Uppercase and lowercase letters are not distinguished for any element.


  # Instruction

  [E (Extract) Extraction]

  Decompress the specified member from the archive.

  If there is a new file with the same name and a new time stamp, it will normally be skipped.
  However, it can be overwritten with the / O option.

  ∙ You can specify the decompression destination drive with the / D <d> option. For example, specify / DH
  Then unzip to H drive.

  If the command is omitted, this e-command will be used.

  (Example 1) A> LHEXT KJFOS173
  Unzip all files in KJFOS173.LZH.

  (Example 2) A> LHEXT KJFOS173 * .DOC * .COM
  Unzip the file with the extension DOC and the file with the extension COM in KJFOS173.LZH.

  (Example 3) A> LHEXT KJFOS173 KJFOS.COM / O
  Unzip KJFOS.COM in overwrite mode from KJFOS173.LZH.

  (Example 4) A> LHEXT / DH EX K *. *
  Unzip the file whose name begins with K in EX.LZH to drive H.


  [X (eXtract with directory) Unzip with directory]

  If the path name is recorded in the archive, unzip it to that path. Digging directory
  If you can, dig.

  This is valid only for MSX-DOS2, and is the same as the e command for MSX-DOS1.

  ∙ The / O and / D options are valid as with the e command.

  (Example 5) A> LHEXT X LSIC330
  Unzip LSIC330.LZH with directory.

  (Example 6) A> LHEXT X LSIC330 * .EXE * .H / O
  Extract files with extensions EXE and H from LSIC330.LZH with directories
    To do. At this time, the overwrite mode is set.


  [List of l (List)]

  Displays a list of members in the archive.
  ”“ ”Is displayed at the beginning of the file for members whose path is also recorded.

  This display can be redirected even in DOS1.

  (Example 7) A> LHEXT L TEST
  Displays all files in TEST.LZH.

  (Example 8) A> LHEXT LSIC330 * .OBJ / L> LSIC_OBJ.LST
  A list of files with the extension OBJ in LSIC330.LZH is called LSIC_OBJ.LST
  Export to


  [V (View) list]

  Displays a list of members in the archive.
  ∙ Similar to the l command, but if a path is recorded, it is also displayed.  

  [T (Test) inspection]

  Test the archive. By checking the CRC of the files in the archive,
  Inspect the file for corruption.

  (Example 9) A> LHEXT T TESTPACK
  Check all files in TESTPACK.LZH.


  # Option

  [/] O [|-] Overwrite mode specification]

  When decompressing, specify whether to overwrite when the same name file exists in the decompression destination.
  Valid with the e command and x command.

  If / O is overwritten, / O- is skipped.
  If you omit [|-] and just use / O, the current status is reversed. The startup state is / O-.


  [/ D <drive> Extraction drive specification]

  Set the drive to decompress to <drive>.
  Valid with the e command and x command.


  Environment variable LHEXT

  ∙ You can write default commands and options in the environment variable LHEXT. However
  It is valid only for DOS2.

  (Example 10) A> SET LHEXT = X / O

  If you do this, if you omit the command, the x command will be selected and the / O option will always be used.
  Will start.
  In this state, specify / O- on the command line to start with the / O option removed.

  (Example 10-1) A> LHEXT /O-TEST.LZH


  # Compatible compression format
  The following compression formats can be decompressed.
  -lh0- uncompressed format
  -lh1- Compressed with old LHarc.exe (MS-DOS) or LHA.COM (CP / M)
  -lh5- Compressed with LHa.exe (MS-DOS)
  -lh6- Compressed with the new version of LHA (MS-DOS) under trial (as of March 6, 95)
  -lhd- An empty directory that can be created with the new version of LHA (MS-DOS)

  -lh4- -lh5- is half the dictionary size. However, “deem” to be the same as -lh5-
  Can also be used, so it is actually -lh4-, but it may be recorded as -lh5-
  There is.
  -lh7- Although there is a standard in the new version LHA (MS-DOS), it is still compressed in this format
  It seems you can't.

  The following compression formats are not supported
  -lh2- -lh3- -lzs- -lz5- -pm1- -pm2-

  Compressed format can be confirmed with l command. l If the command cannot display the list
  Is a library that doesn't support in the first place (^^;
  In the above format, the list can be displayed with the l command even if decompression is not supported.
  Noh.

  -Lhd- does not decompress (?) Unless it is an x command.
