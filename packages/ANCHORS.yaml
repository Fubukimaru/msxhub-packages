  # Anchors Aweigh!
  
  A puzzle game based on the Battleship game:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(puzzle)
  
  ### Goal of the game:
  
  (from wikipedia:)
  An armada of battleships is hidden in a square grid of 10×10 small squares.
  Each ship occupies a number of contiguous squares on the grid, arranged horizontally or vertically.
  The ships are placed so that no ship touches any other ship, not even diagonally.
  The goal is to find them.
  A grid may start with clues in the form of squares that have already been solved, showing a submarine, an end piece of a ship, a middle piece of a ship, or water.
  Each row and column also has a number beside it, indicating the number of squares occupied by ship parts in that row or column, respectively.
  
  Instructions are included in the game itself, in several languages, albeit I definitely need to improve my Dutch :)
