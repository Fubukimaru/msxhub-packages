  Hey kids, remember The Very Hungry Caterpillar?
  
  Well, now we actually get to play one, in a Snake-inspired (yes, the eating one, but not the one eating in the jungle) classic experience.
  
  Contrary to most games of this type, you’ll only die when you manage to take a bite out of your own body, but this variant adds extra strategy by having a very maze-like map layout, so we’ll have to be careful about the path to take in order to gobble up all of the goodies.
  
  This adds a fresh puzzle element which we hope will entertain you.
