description: |
  This player plays 15.7 kHz or 7.85 kHz PCM on the MSX-MUSIC. The PCM file must
  be 8-bit raw PCM data at one of the aforementioned frequencies. By default the
  file is interpreted signed, but there is an option to provide unsigned data.
  Since 15.7 kHz requires nearly 1 MB per minute, you do need sufficient memory
  to fit the sample. If the sample doesn’t fit it will be truncated.
  
  It works by forcing the phase generator to hold on a specified phase using test
  register bit 2. This allows it to index into the sine table and produce
  accurate near 8-bit sample playback with a simple inverse lookup table.
  
  The playback is timed by synchronizing to the VDP line drawing frequency, which
  provides a good high-frequency timer on MSX2 that is CPU speed independent.
  Additionally it lets us render a nice visualisation during playback.
