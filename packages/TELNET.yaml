description: |
  It is a TELNET client that allow you to connect to a TELNET server and interact
  with it. If used along with MEMMAN and JANSI it will be able to receive and
  show ANSI escape codes / colors. How is it different than TCPCON?
  
    - It implement TELNET negotiations, as such, echo is used as the other end
      requests (no need to turn on or off manually), tell terminal type (Dumb
      if JANSI is not running or xterm 16 colors otherwise), tell window size
      as 80x24 if JANSI is not running or 80x25 otherwise). Also will respond
      to ANSI request to cursor position, some BBS's use this to detect if
      terminal is ANSI capable (this is done only once or until enter is
      pressed so performance is not impacted by analyzing it along with other
      ANSI escape codes)
    
    - If using JANSI, ANSI capabilities are automatically detected by most BBSs
    
    - It will use MS-DOS character set, which allow seeing ANSI animations and
      menus as they are.
    
    - It accesses JANSI directly instead of using JANSI built in hook into DOS
      functions, also it will initialize JANSI if it is installed but screen
      mode is not JANSI
    
    - Will send all data to be printed at once once it is received and not do
      it byte per byte (and in case of JANSI uses DMPSTR function)
    
    - It supports receiving files through XMODEM CRC, XMODEM 1K CRC, YMODEM and
      YMODEM-G, including file batch in YMODEM/YMODEM-G
