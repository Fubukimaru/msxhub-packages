description: |
  This is an MGS file player that works when MGSDRV is installed.
  It has almost the same purpose as Ain's MGSEL, but with the following differences

  Advantages over MGSEL:

  1. It also works on MSX1.
  2. Song titles can be displayed in a mixture of kanji and kana even without a kanji ROM.
  3. You can control it with the joypad.

  Inferior to MGSEL:
  1. It consumes a lot of MapperRAM.
  2. Mouse operation is not possible.
  3. There are many features that MGSEL has, but MGSP doesn't.

  Usage:
  Execute from the command prompt in the following order.

  ```
  A:\> MAINROMP
  A:\> MGSDRV /Z
  A:\> MGSP
  ```

  (*) MAINROMP does not need to be run on MSX2 or later; it is a workaround for a problem where MGSDRV v3.20 may not start on MSX1.
