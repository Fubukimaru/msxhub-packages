description: |
  A tool for MSX-DOS that allows you to easily edit binary files saved on floppy disks.
  Since the files on the disk are directly rewritten, you can edit files up to 8MB regardless of the amount of RAM in the main unit.

  * Never open a file that should not be rewritten, as it will be auto-saved at any time.

  * We cannot handle any troubles caused by using this tool, so please take your own risk.

  ## Operating environment

  MSX running MSX-DOS or MSX-DOS2

  ## Execution method

  * Please download and extract the file from the link above.
  * TBED.COM is the main body of the tool. Copy it to an MSX-DOS (or DOS2) disk in advance.
  * Start MSX-DOS (or DOS2) and enter the following at the command prompt.
  ```
  TBED file name
  ```

  ## Basic operation

  * Use the cursor keys to move the cursor and edit the data.
  * If you hold down [SHIFT], [CTRL], and [GRAPH] and press the cursor keys, the cursor will move in units of 100H, 1000H, and 10000H, respectively.
  * Press [ESC] to exit the tool and return to DOS. Be sure to exit the tool after use. Also, do not remove the disc until you exit the tool.
  * The following commands are available.
    * [CTRL] + [F]… Search for the specified data. When searching for multiple bytes of data, enter them consecutively without any spaces.
      * Example) If you want to search for 3 bytes called 41 42 90, enter "414290" when "FIND>" is displayed.
    * [F3]… Re-searches the previously searched data from the current cursor position.
    * [CTRL] + [J]… Jumps to the specified address.
    * [CTRL] + [Z]… Cancels the previous edit.
  * The search takes time because it is performed while reading the data from the disk. You can cancel halfway by pressing any key during the search.
