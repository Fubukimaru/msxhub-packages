  # Raftoid
  
  The era and time of this story is mostly unknown.
  After contact was lost with the mother ship "Arkanoid", a search and rescue ship "Raftoid" was sent
  It took many years to arrive at the place, only to be warped in space too, just a little diffent this time
  
  # Intro
  
  Raftoid is an Arkanoid-style game written in MSX Basic
  It is not fast enough to be run as-is, so it needs to be compiled with x-basic/MSX-Basic-Kun
  
  This directory has some examples of partial code and details.
  
  The actual version with all its files is in the `disk` directory, which is the one to be deplyed.
  
  Try the current version on WebMXS: https://webmsx.org/?DISK=https://github.com/plattysoft/MSX/raw/master/raftoid/Raftoid.dsk&MACHINE=MSX1E
  
  ## PowerUps:
  
  Current powerups:
  
  * Yellow ("Rich"): bricks give double points
  * Blue ("Anchor"): ball sticks to the paddle
  * Red ("Fireball"): ball gets through bricks
  
  ## Extra lives
  
  There are extra lives at
  * 5000
  * 10000
  * 20000
  * 40000
  * 80000
  ... and so on
  
  ## Levels
  
  There are 5 levels, once completed, the game cycles them again
  
  * Wall
  * Face
  * Diamond
  * Arrow
  * Wave
  
  There are 3 backgrounds, so to see each level with each background you need to reach Stage 15. After that point it just repeats.
