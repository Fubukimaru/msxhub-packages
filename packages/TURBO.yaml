description: |
  Formerly known as Fudeba Turbo Changer, this program was created to fulfill the need for a "turbo" utility  that was able to switch turbo state on any MSX computer with a simple command.
  
  Actually it supports all known MSX computers with soft-operated turbo (see below for more info); I'll try to update this software as new machines are built.
  
  Supported systems are:
  
  - ASCII One Chip MSX
  - CIEL MSX 2.0 Turbo
  - CIEL MSX 2+ Turbo
  - Panasonic MSX Turbo R GT
  - Panasonic MSX Turbo R ST
  - Panasonic MSX FS A1 WSX
  - Panasonic MSX FS A1 WX
  - Panasonic MSX FS A1 FX
  - Zemmix Neo
  - Zemmix Neo BR
  
  Features:
  
  - Support CIEL, WSX, WX, FX, Turbo R and OCM turbos.
  - Support Turbo R R800 ROM and DRAM modes
  - Support OCM slow and fast VDP Blitter modes
  - Quiet Mode (fast!)
  - Reverse mode
  - Backward compatible with A&L Software Turbo.Com
