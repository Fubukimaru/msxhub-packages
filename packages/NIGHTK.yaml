description: |
  Sir Bernard is cursed. The only way he can get some sleep at night is by taking a long walk, which is not easy at all when you live in an enchanted castle!
  
  Help the old knight to break the curse and get some rest by walking around the castle avoiding all the hostile creatures that inhabit the walls of Scarkeep.
  
  Night Knight is a single-screen platformer with a strong classic arcade feel. Race against the clock to step over all the tiles in the room, pick up the key and exit through the door to the next stage.
  
  The game has 80 stages and is NTSC and PAL compatible.
