description: |
  Bumper Ship Racing is a racing game, just as simple as that. Try to cross the finish line before your opponents do. There are three different modes: Cup Race, Single Race, and Time Trial. All tracks are raced for four laps except in Time Trial mode. The player can choose from three ship models which all have different features.
  
  As the name says, bumping is the secret to become the best racer, as your ship tends to bump into all the walls, setting the stage for a learning curve considering the control at the first few plays.
