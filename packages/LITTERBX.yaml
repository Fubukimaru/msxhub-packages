description: |
  According to a popular theory, cats are really plotting to take over the world. And arguably, that could be for the best. It’s not a far stretch to suppose that our hairy friends would do a better job than us, warmongering humans.
  
  In every stage: Avoid both dogs (these are your enemies), eat ALL cat food (dots) and when all dots are eaten RETURN to the LITTER BOX in the middle.
