description: |
  Dreams Puzzle follows the classic mechanics of sliding puzzles but in this case the pictures look awesome thanks to the artwork made by [Josephine Wall](http://www.josephinewall.co.uk/) who granted her  kind permission to use it in this game.
  
  Dreams Puzzle uses the screen mode B3/512x424/16bpp and 32768 colors and features music by MSX chiptune veteran Meits.
