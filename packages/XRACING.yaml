  XRacing is an arcade-simulation racing game where you play the role of a driver trying to become Formula 1 world champion. To achieve your goal, you will have to first prove you are worthy of driving in Formula 1 though! Before you can compete in Formula 1, you will have to play through two previous seasons: stock cars and endurance cars. Each season being harder than the previous one as your car gets faster and faster, and it's harder to control! You will also have to manage yur cash, as you will have to pay entry fees to every race, and also you will have to save money to buy better cars. Luckily, you have an agent that represents you and can give you some advise.
  
  XRacing is an MSX1 game, in a 48KB ROM cartridge format, built to participate in the MSXDev'18 competition ( https://www.msxdev.org ).
  
  XRacing is a tribute to a few of the car racing games I loved as a kid. In particular Super Cars ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Cars ), but there are references to many other games like F-1 Spirit (MSX), 4D Sports Driving (Amiga/DOS), and others! The one thing that I set out to do was a top-view car racing game with smooth multidirectional scroll, which was quite a challenge! The final solution I adopted limits significantly the amount of graphic variety in the screen (and that's why levels look a bit empty), but it more than makes up for it allowing smooth scroll, which I think adds a lot to the experience.
