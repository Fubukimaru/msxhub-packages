description: |
  This program plays .AY files ripped from ZX-Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. The file format looks a bit like the KSS files 
  which are ripped from MSX (it contains the song data as well as the player routines) and was originally introduced for 
  DeliPlayer on the Amiga. .

  RoboAY has a build in Z80 emulator (made by NYYRIKKI) so a fast CPU is needed (read: Turbo-R). The emulator is used to 
  simulate both ZX-Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. The program is MSX-DOS2 based and needs at least 128KB of memory.
  Included are a number of demonstration songs, a lot more can be found on the Project AY pages:
  http://www.worldofspectrum.org/projectay/gdmusic.htm.

  Not playing are 'beeper' songs (old ZX-48) and 'samples' since the emulation is too slow for this.
