description: |
  This program acts as a general CAS file loader, and can be used on any MSX2
  with 128K memory mapper. Basically, it copies the bios to ram and patches it,
  redirecting the tape reading routines. This method allows any CAS file on disk
  to be handled by the system as a real tape.
  
  The program takes the form of a generic loader, which must be copied to the
  same disk or directory where the CAS file is, renaming to match its filename.
  For example, if you have `ZARTH.CAS`, do `COPY"LOADCAS"TO"ZARTH.BIN"` or simply
  `TO"ZARTH"` (extension doesn't count). Then execute with `BLOAD"ZARTH",R`. The
  program will set the system up and start loading with the proper command.
